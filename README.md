## Liming Zhang: AI + Big Data
- 🔭 I’m currently Ph.D. Candidate working on **Bayesian Deep Learning** and **AI for human behavior prediction**.
- 🌱 I’m widely interested in bridging the gap between ML and software engineer, so it is easier to implement an AI-enabled system.
- I like to read papers in: Deep Learning, Data Mining, Adversarial Network (GAN), Unsupervised Learning (VAE), Graph Deep Learning, Bayesian graphical models, NLP, Spatial-temporal series
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have two dogs and I really ❤️ my 🐶s
